# GDD-Client

This is the frontend of a fullstack app that allows game developers to create, edit, and collaborate on Game Design Documents (GDD). 

These documents outline the main elements of a game (mechanics, story, characters, locations, etc.) and are used to guide development. This [article] on Wikipedia has further explanation and links to examples of GDDs.

The site can be visited [here].
